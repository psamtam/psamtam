Hi there~

I'm Sam from HK, and I'm currently moving to the UK.

Not many things on GitHub yet... but I've worked on a variety of hardware and software projects, including:
- Developing Machine Learning Algorithm & Dataset for Driving Behaviours Classification
- DIY FFB Wheel
- DIY Carb Sync Gauge
- DIY Deej Volume Mixer w/ Macro Buttons
- DIY Laptop Water Cooling
- DIY Wireless Charger
- DIY NumPad
and lots more...
