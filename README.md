Hi there~

I'm Sam from HK, and I'm currently moving to the UK.

Not many things on GitHub yet... but I've worked on a variety of hardware and software projects, including:
- DIY FFB Wheel
- DIY Wireless Charger
- DIY Deej Volume Mixer w/ Macro Buttons
- DIY Laptop Water Cooling
- DIY NumPad
- DIY Carb Sync Gauge
and lots more...
